Scenario:

A procurement system has been developed for the purchasing department. The
intended use of the system is to allow staff in any department to easily search
for a component and view a list of approved suppliers for that component.
Purchasing staff, as administrators of the system, maintain the list of
components, and suppliers.

This system has been running for a while, and the purchasing staff have
requested the following feature:

"Currently the system allows us to store a representative name, and
representative email for each supplier - however some suppliers have multiple
representatives. We would like the system to handle multiple representatives
and their contact information for a supplier. We would like to maintain the
contact data as admin staff, and users should also have the ability to view
this information."

What to do:

The source code for the application in its current state can be cloned using
git at the following url:

git@github.com:iainworkman/coding-assignment.git

Using your best judgement for data structure, security, user interface, API
completeness, and code maintainability, please implement the feature request
described above.

Note that if you fork the project, your github account information will be
visible to others browsing that repository. To protect your privacy, you may
want to download and start a new repository, or work with a zip and send us
back your zipped files.

If you need to adjust this exercise to best demonstrate your capabilities, or
you need assistance getting the project started please let us know.

Good luck.
